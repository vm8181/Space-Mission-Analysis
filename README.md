# Mission Space Analysis

All space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission.

- How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?
- Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?
- Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?
- Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?
