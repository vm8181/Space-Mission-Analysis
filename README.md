# Mission Space Analysis

All space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission.

- How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?
- Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?
- Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?
- Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?

## Conclusion
- France has the most successful rate towards space mission. You can observe that USA has launched more rockets than other countries but they have more failure as compare to France and Russia.
- Cosmos-3M(11K65M) is the rocket which is used most of sapce missions and It has retired not active.

- Site 31/6, Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan is the site where most of the missions have launched in space mission history i.e. 251

## Lessons Learned

I have explored interesting websites while building this project that helps me in designing the Power BI dashboard.
